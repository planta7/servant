## Reporting Security Issues

If you have encountered a potential security vulnerability in this project,
please report it to us at <roberto@planta7.io>. We will work with you to
verify the vulnerability and patch it.

**DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions,
or pull requests.**

Please include as much of the information listed below as you can to help us better
understand and resolve the issue:

* The type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)
* Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
* The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
* Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
* Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
* Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

We request that you contact us via the email address above and give the
project contributors a chance to resolve the vulnerability and issue a new
release prior to any public exposure; this helps protect the project's
users, and provides them with a chance to upgrade and/or update in order to
protect their applications.

## Policy

If we verify a reported security vulnerability, our policy is:

- We will patch the current release branch, as well as the immediate prior minor
  release branch.

- After patching the release branches, we will immediately issue new security
  fix releases for each patched release branch.

- A security advisory will be released detailing the vulnerability, as well as
  recommendations for end-users to protect themselves. Security advisories will 
  be listed at https://github.com/planta7/servant/security/advisories.
